Front fork cable clip for Ariel Rider Grizzly bike.

I made this replacement part because both the clips that came from the factory
were broken on arrival.

Parameters to tweak:

- `tube_diameter` - the diameter of your bike fork tube. (35.8mm)
- `cable_diameter` - the diameter of the brake cable. (5.4mm)
- `ring_thickness` - thickness of the wall between inner and outer circles. (2.4mm; a multiple of 0.4 because I have a 0.4mm print nozzle.)
